  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.

      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. It's the global object in non-strict mode. (Simple Function Call)
    2. Points to the object on which the function is called, what's on the left of the period. (Implicit Binding)
    3. Explicitly tell Javascript to set "this" to point to a certain value using call, apply or bind. (Explicit Binding)
    4. Using the "new" keyword constructs a new object, and "this" point it. (New Binding)
