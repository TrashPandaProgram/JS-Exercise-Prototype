  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.
*/

function Airplane(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.isFlying = false;
  }
  Airplane.prototype.takeOff = function () {
    this.isFlying = true;
  };

    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
      - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
          + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
          + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

    TASK 2
      - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.

          + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
          + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
      - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
          + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

    TASK 3
      - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.

  /* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. It's the global object in non-strict mode. (Simple Function Call)
    2. Points to the object on which the function is called, what's on the left of the period. (Implicit Binding)
    3. Explicitly tell Javascript to set "this" to point to a certain value using call, apply or bind. (Explicit Binding)
    4. Using the "new" keyword constructs a new object, and "this" point it. (New Binding)
